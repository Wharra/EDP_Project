# 🧮 Allen–Cahn Equation: From Physics to Quantitative Finance

## 📘 Description

This project explores the **Allen–Cahn equation**, a fundamental **reaction–diffusion model** initially introduced in 1979 by *Samuel M. Allen* and *John W. Cahn* to describe **phase separation** in continuous media.
It is based on the **Ginzburg–Landau free energy** and captures the evolution of interfaces between two stable states.

The study combines **theoretical analysis**, **numerical simulation**, and **financial interpretation**, showing how mathematical models from physics can inspire models in **quantitative finance**.

## 🧠 Methodology

1. **Theoretical formulation** – Presentation of the Allen–Cahn PDE and its physical meaning.
2. **Numerical implementation** – Discretization in 1D using:

   * **Explicit Euler scheme**
   * **Semi-implicit scheme** (tridiagonal system resolution)
3. **Comparison with exact solutions** – Manufactured solutions used to validate numerical accuracy.
4. **Applications in finance** – The diffusion–reaction framework is linked to pricing models such as:

   * **Black–Scholes PDE** for option pricing
   * **Local volatility models** incorporating diffusion and reaction terms

## 🧩 Tools & Skills

* Numerical analysis of **PDEs**
* Discretization and stability (CFL condition)
* Python / MATLAB for simulations
* Visualization of solution evolution
* Application of **mathematical modeling to finance**

## 💼 Financial Relevance

The Allen–Cahn model’s **diffusion–reaction duality** mirrors several **financial PDEs**, especially in option pricing and volatility modeling.
It provides a unified framework connecting **physical diffusion** with **financial risk diffusion**, supporting advanced studies in:

* **Quantitative modeling**
* **Derivatives pricing (Black–Scholes type models)**
* **Volatility surface smoothing and prediction**
